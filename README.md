# Brief — DIN 5008 compliant letters with Quarto

This quarto extension provides a letter template that adheres to the German [DIN
5008](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_5008) requirements, based on the
`scrlttr2` LaTeX document class.

## Usage

Install the extension and example qmd file as follows:

```bash
quarto use template mavam/brief
```

Then adapt the example as you see fit.

## Format Options

The sample [template.qmd](template.qmd) demonstrates all available tuning knobs.
Many options are directly lifted from the `scrlttr2` class.

## Credits

I got inspired by Mickaël Canouil's
[quarto-letter](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-letter) extension, but needed
something that adheres to DIN 5008.
